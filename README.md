# Screen-Recorder
A screen recorder is a tool that allows you to capture video footage of your computer screen.
It records everything that is displayed on the screen, including mouse movements, keystrokes, and audio.
Screen recorders are often used for creating instructional videos, demonstrations, presentations, or tutorials, where it is helpful to show the viewer how to perform a specific task on a computer.
They are also used by gamers to record and share their gameplay, and by professionals to create software demos or training videos.
